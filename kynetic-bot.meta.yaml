    trigger: manual
    description: Core pattern for working on a task. Full lifecycle from start through PR merge.
    steps:
      - type: check
        content: |
          Check for existing in_progress or pending_review tasks.
          Use: kspec session start (shows active work first)
          Priority: pending_review > in_progress > ready
        on_fail: |
          Inherit existing work instead of starting new.
          Pick up in_progress task and continue, or check PR status for pending_review.
          Only start new work if user explicitly says to ignore existing work.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Choose task to work on.
          Use: kspec tasks ready to see available tasks
          Or: kspec task get @task to see task details
        inputs:
          - name: task_ref
            description: Reference to the task (e.g., @task-slug)
            type: ref
      - type: check
        content: |
          Verify work is not already done.
          Check git history: git log --oneline --grep="feature-name"
          Read implementation code if it exists.
        on_fail: Mark task complete with "Already implemented" reason
      - type: action
        content: |
          Start the task.
          Use: kspec task start @task
          This marks the task in_progress.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Work on the task, adding notes as you go.
          Use: kspec task note @task "What you're doing..."
          Add notes during work, not just at end.
      - type: check
        content: All changes committed
        on_fail: |
          Commit changes with Task: @task trailer.
          Example: git commit -m "feat: description\n\nTask: @task-slug"
      - type: action
        content: |
          Submit task for review.
          Use: kspec task submit @task
          This marks the task pending_review (code done, awaiting merge).
      - type: action
        content: |
          Create PR.
          Use: /pr skill or gh pr create
          After PR created, EXIT this iteration.
          Ralph spawns a PR review subagent for holistic review of the session's work.
        exit: true
        exit_note: |
          PR review is a separate session with broader focus:
          - Review the PR changes holistically, not just task checklist
          - Check for unintended side effects or scope creep
          - Verify AC coverage: each acceptance criterion should have test with AC annotation
          - Check for inline AC comments (// AC: @spec-item ac-N) linking code to criteria
          - Verify tests cover the actual behavior, not just acceptance criteria
          - Consider code quality, maintainability, and consistency
          After PR merged: kspec task complete @task --reason "Summary"

    id: session-reflect
    trigger: session-end
    description: Structured reflection after work sessions. Surfaces learnings, identifies friction, and
      captures improvements for system evolution.
    steps:
      - type: action
        content: |
          Identify what worked well this session.
          Be specific: "categorizing items first" not "good planning".
          Consider: workflows, tools/commands, communication, decisions.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Identify friction points - where things were harder than needed.
          Focus on systemic issues, not one-off mistakes.
          Consider: repetitive steps, missing commands, context loss, workarounds.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Check if friction points are already tracked.
          Search specs, tasks, AND inbox before proposing new improvements.
          For each: note if already tracked, partially covered, or untracked.
        exit_criteria:
          - Searched specs for relevant features
          - Searched tasks for existing work
          - Searched inbox for captured ideas
      - type: action
        content: |
          For untracked friction, propose concrete improvements.
          Include: what it would do, how it helps, rough scope (small/medium/large).
      - type: decision
        content: Present findings to user - ask about each improvement one at a time
        options:
          - Worth capturing -> proceed to capture
          - Needs refinement -> discuss and refine
          - Not worth it -> skip and continue
          - Done with reflection -> complete workflow
      - type: action
        content: |
          Capture approved items using appropriate destination:
          - Actionable improvements: kspec inbox add "..." --tag reflection
          - Friction patterns: kspec meta observe friction "..."
          - Success patterns: kspec meta observe success "..."
          - Open questions: kspec meta question add "..."

    trigger: pr-merge
    description: Quality gate for reviewing and merging PRs. Ensures all CI passes, all reviews
      addressed, all requests completed, and all threads resolved before merge.
    steps:
      - type: check
        content: All CI checks complete (none pending or running)
        on_fail: Wait for CI to finish. Do not merge while checks are running.
      - type: check
        content: All CI checks pass (green)
        on_fail: Fix failures, push changes, wait for CI to re-run and pass.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Read ALL review comments on the PR.
          Use: gh pr view --comments or GitHub UI
          Check for: automated reviews, human reviews, inline comments.
      - type: check
        content: All review feedback addressed
        on_fail: |
          Fix each issue raised by reviewers.
          Push changes and wait for re-review if needed.
      - type: action
        content: |
          Check for @claude mentions or other requests in comments.
          Look for actions the PR agent couldn't complete (limited permissions).
          Examples: add inbox items, run kspec commands, update tasks.
      - type: check
        content: All requested actions completed
        on_fail: Complete the actions yourself before proceeding.
      - type: check
        content: All review threads resolved in GitHub UI
        on_fail: Click "Resolve conversation" on each thread after addressing.
      - type: decision
        content: Ready to merge?
        options:
          - Yes - all checks green, all reviews addressed, all threads resolved
          - No - need user approval to merge with known issues
          - Skip - user explicitly said to merge anyway
      - type: action
        content: |
          Merge the PR.
          Use: gh pr merge (prefer merge commit to preserve trailers)
          Or: GitHub UI merge button

    id: inbox-triage
    trigger: session-start
    description: Systematic processing of inbox items into specs and tasks.
    steps:
      - type: action
        content: |
          Get context and list inbox items.
          Use: kspec session start --full
          Use: kspec inbox list
      - type: action
        content: |
          Categorize items by type:
          - Bugs
          - Spec gaps
          - Quick wins
          - Larger features (need plan mode)
          - Delete candidates
      - type: decision
        content: Process each item - is it still relevant?
        options:
          - No -> delete it
          - Yes, spec exists -> promote to task
          - Yes, need spec -> create spec first
          - Unclear -> leave for later
      - type: action
        content: |
          For behavior changes, follow spec-first approach:
          1. Check if spec covers the change
          2. Create or update spec with AC if needed
          3. Derive task or promote inbox item

conventions:
  - _ulid: 01KG2005000000000000000000
    domain: commits
    rules:
      - Use conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore)
      - Include Task trailer when completing task work
      - Include Spec trailer when implementing spec item
      - Keep subject line under 72 characters
    examples:
      - good: "feat: add user login flow\n\nTask: @add-auth"
        bad: "Added login"
      - good: "fix(auth): handle expired tokens"
        bad: "fixed bug"

  - _ulid: 01KG2006000000000000000000
    domain: notes
    rules:
      - Add notes during work, not just at end
      - Include context for decisions made
      - Reference related commits, PRs, or issues
    examples:
      - good: "Using retry with exponential backoff. Chose 3 max retries based on API rate limits."
        bad: "Done"
