    content: Using TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks provides clear progress tracking and prevents
      skipped steps. Breaking tasks like 'setup vitest' into 6 subtodos made progress visible and
      ensured nothing was missed.

    content: "PR workflow requires 6 repetitive steps per task: create branch, push, create PR, merge,
      checkout main, pull. Repeated 4 times this session. The /pr skill exists but doesn't handle
      the full cycle including post-merge cleanup."

    content: Created 6 identical vitest.config.ts files using bash loop workaround. No built-in way to
      create multiple files from template. Used heredoc in for loop which works but feels like
      missing tool capability.
