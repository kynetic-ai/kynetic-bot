    content: Using TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks provides clear progress tracking and prevents
      skipped steps. Breaking tasks like 'setup vitest' into 6 subtodos made progress visible and
      ensured nothing was missed.

    content: "PR workflow requires 6 repetitive steps per task: create branch, push, create PR, merge,
      checkout main, pull. Repeated 4 times this session. The /pr skill exists but doesn't handle
      the full cycle including post-merge cleanup."

    content: Created 6 identical vitest.config.ts files using bash loop workaround. No built-in way to
      create multiple files from template. Used heredoc in for loop which works but feels like
      missing tool capability.

    content: Task dependency chain automatically managed ready state - @01KG1TCV became ready
      immediately after @01KG2ER6 completed, no manual coordination needed. This validates the
      depends_on relationship model.

    content: Build artifacts (dist/, *.tsbuildinfo, node_modules subdirs) appear in git status and must
      be manually excluded when staging. Task @01KG2ESG only covers coverage/ but pattern applies to
      all build output.
