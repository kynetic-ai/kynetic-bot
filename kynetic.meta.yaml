    content: Using TodoWrite tool for multi-step tasks provides clear progress tracking and prevents
      skipped steps. Breaking tasks like 'setup vitest' into 6 subtodos made progress visible and
      ensured nothing was missed.

    content: Created 6 identical vitest.config.ts files using bash loop workaround. No built-in way to
      create multiple files from template. Used heredoc in for loop which works but feels like
      missing tool capability.

      directly to main (not creating PR branches) reduces overhead for automation-eligible tasks.

    content: KyneticError constructor parameter order (message, code) is opposite of typical Error(code,
      message) patterns. Led to initial implementation errors in SizeLimitError and
      UnsupportedMediaTypeError. Consider documenting parameter order prominently or adding JSDoc
      examples.
