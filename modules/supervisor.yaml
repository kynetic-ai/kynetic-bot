    acceptance_criteria:
      - id: ac-1
        given: supervisor starts
        when: spawn() called
        then: spawns kbot with IPC channel
      - id: ac-2
        given: kbot running
        when: supervisor receives SIGTERM
        then: sends SIGTERM to child, waits for graceful exit
      - id: ac-3
        given: kbot exits code 0
        when: exit detected
        then: supervisor exits cleanly (no respawn)
      - id: ac-4
        given: kbot exits non-zero
        when: exit detected
        then: respawns with exponential backoff
      - id: ac-5
        given: backoff reaches max (60s)
        when: spawn fails again
        then: emits escalation event, continues retrying
      - id: ac-6
        given: kbot spawned
        when: child starts
        then: logs PID, sets up IPC handlers
      - id: ac-7
        given: IPC channel setup fails
        when: spawn attempted
        then: logs error, retries spawn
      - id: ac-8
        given: supervisor crashes
        when: child running
        then: child orphaned, continues running (container/systemd restarts supervisor)
