    text: Spec review workflow/skill that runs verification + holistic review after spec changes. Would
      automate the repeated 'run two subagents to check plan vs implementation and find gaps'
      pattern.

    text: "Clarify @trait-recoverable ac-3: 'escalates with context on unrecoverable state' is
      ambiguous. Does 'escalates' mean direct EscalationHandler call, or emitting error events that
      something else can act on? Current implementations emit error events. Suggest clarifying that
      event emission with sufficient context satisfies this AC, with orchestrator responsible for
      escalation policy."
