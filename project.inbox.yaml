      Bot Personality System Design (from triage discussion):


      **System prompt injection (always included):**

      - Core identity (name, role, boundaries)

      - Recent important events/info


      **Storage (via kspec primitives in .kbot/):**

      - identity section in kbot.meta.yaml

      - observations for learned patterns

      - session context for ephemeral state


      **Communication preferences to track:**

      - Verbosity (concise/detailed)

      - Formality (casual/professional)  

      - Structure (bullets/prose)

      - Expertise level assumption


      **Evolution:**

      - Explicit: User tells bot directly

      - Reflection: Automatic + collaborative with user

      - Implicit: Derived from reflection


      **Blocked on:** kspec library integration (01KG756X) - should use kspec observations/meta
      rather than custom implementation


      **Research captured:** See personalization research from triage session - memory taxonomies,
      what to track, anti-patterns

      Bug: ACP tool_call events show generic titles because rawInput arrives in separate updates


      ACTUAL EVENT STRUCTURE:

      - Event 1 (seq N): { rawInput: {}, title: "Read File", kind: "read", status: "pending" }

      - Event 2 (seq N+1): { rawInput: { file_path: "...", title: "Read /path/to/file.ts", status:
      "completed" }


      PROBLEM:

      When extractToolInputFromAcp() processes Event 1:

      1. rawInput is empty object → falls through to title parsing

      2. Title is generic "Read File" → regex extracts "File"

      3. Event 2 arrives but tool call already formatted with "File" instead of the path


      ROOT CAUSE:

      ACP streams tool_call events incrementally. The payload/title/rawInput are populated LATER in
      a separate tool_call_update event. Current extraction logic doesn't detect or handle this
      streaming pattern.


      FAILED EXTRACTION PATH:

      Line 643: title.match(/^(?:Read|Write|Edit...)\s+(.+)/i) matches "Read File" and extracts last
      word


      EVIDENCE:

      - Real test data in /home/chapel/Projects/kbot-test/.kbot/sessions/dc3b15d4.../events.jsonl
      shows first tool_call has title "Read File" with empty rawInput

      - Turn-reconstructor.test.ts line 1380-1408 has passing test that works because test data
      already has full path in title

      - Test never encounters the real "Read File" generic title case


      PROPOSED FIX:

      1. When rawInput is empty AND title is generic ("Read File", "Terminal", etc), prefer NOT
      extracting from title

      2. Instead return empty string or placeholder, allowing fallback when real data arrives

      3. OR: Check for generic titles and skip extraction, falling back to rawInput only when
      populated

      4. OR: Re-extract input on tool_call_update events when rawInput becomes available

    text: Test files in tool-widgets directory trigger eslint 'File ignored' warning during lint:fix.
      Tests work but warning appears because test files are outside eslint's configured scope when
      run with explicit file paths. Consider adding test directory to eslint include patterns or
      suppressing warning.
