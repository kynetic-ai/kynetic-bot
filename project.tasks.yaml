        ## Scope

        Create initial specification for kynetic-bot core functionality:
        - Cross-platform chat bot with web UI and mobile clients (UI deferred)
        - Leverages kspec for task management and memory/storage
        - Uses/extends ACP for agent execution (like kspec ralph mode)
        - Skills integration

        ## Reference Sources
        - moltbot (GitHub): UX/chat patterns and solved problems
        - ../kynetic: Robust ACP implementation, chat UI, skills
        - ../kynetic-spec: Task/memory foundation

        ## Focus
        Core functionality only - minimum for something functional. No UI specs yet.

        ## Approach
        1. Research all three reference sources
        2. Identify patterns, gaps, and opportunities
        3. Synthesize into spec items with acceptance criteria
        4. Cover explicit and implicit user expectations
