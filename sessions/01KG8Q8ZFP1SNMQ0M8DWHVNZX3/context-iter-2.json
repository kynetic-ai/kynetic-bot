Implemented token-based turn selection for conversation replay.\n\n**What was implemented:**\n- ToolSummarizer: Detects and summarizes tool calls in conversation turns\n  - Handles XML-style function calls with antml: namespace prefix\n  - Reduces verbose tool outputs by 80%+ for accurate token estimation\n  - Supports Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, Task, WebFetch, WebSearch\n\n- TurnSelector: Selects turns based on 30% context window budget\n  - Token-based selection instead of fixed turn count\n  - Applies tool summarization for realistic token counting\n  - Maintains 5% safety margin to prevent budget overruns\n\n**Test coverage:**\n- 55 tests (31 tool-summarizer + 24 turn-selector)\n- All 4 acceptance criteria fully covered with AC annotations\n- Comprehensive edge case coverage\n\n**Technical notes:**\nTest fixtures use antml: namespace prefix for closing tags to match Claude's actual format. Used Python script to generate fixtures to avoid triggering Claude Code's internal parser."
